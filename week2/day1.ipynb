      "text/markdown": "We have two volumes with pages thickness 2 cm each, and each cover thickness 2 mm (0.2 cm). The worm starts at the first page of the first volume and ends at the last page of the second volume, gnawing straight through perpendicularly to the pages (i.e., through the stack of pages and covers along the shelf).\n\nKey setup:\n- Each volume: pages thickness = 2 cm.\n- Each cover thickness = 0.2 cm.\n- Books are on a shelf side by side: order is [Cover A] [Pages A] [Cover A2] [gap between volumes?] [Cover B1] [Pages B] [Cover B2], but since they’re side by side, the adjacent faces that touch (the outer face of a volume vs the inner face toward the other volume) matter.\n- The worm goes from the first page of the first volume to the last page of the second volume. “First page” means the very first page inside Volume 1 (the page closest to the front cover). “Last page” means the last page inside Volume 2 (the page closest to the back cover).\n\nWe need the distance through which the worm gnawed along the shelf direction. The path goes straight through:\n- From the first page of Vol 1 to the inner face of Vol 1’s front cover: through the page near the front, but the worm starts at that first page, so no distance inside the cover before it starts; it then has to go through the rest of Volume 1’s structure to reach the back of Volume 1 and into the space between volumes, then into Volume 2, and finally to the last page of Volume 2.\n\nA classic trick in this problem: the worm travels along the line of the shelf, so the total distance is simply the sum of the cover thicknesses that lie between the two end pages, plus the thickness of the pages it traverses along the way. But since it starts at the first page of Volume 1, it does not traverse the pages of Volume 1 from the first page to the back of Volume 1; instead, it must traverse:\n- The remaining pages of Volume 1 after the first page\n- The inner cover of Volume 1 (the back cover)\n- The gap between the volumes (if any) — but typically the books touch, so no gap beyond the covers\n- The inner front cover of Volume 2 (the cover adjacent to Volume 1)\n- The pages of Volume 2 up to the last page\n\nCompute:\n\nVolume 1:\n- Pages thickness = 2 cm. If we start at the first page, the distance through Volume 1's pages is the rest of the pages thickness: 2 cm − 0 (first page considered negligible thickness) but more precisely, the worm starts at the first page and goes to the back of Volume 1, which means it traverses the remaining pages thickness equal to 2 cm minus the thickness of the first page. However, standard puzzle assumes the \"first page\" is at the very front of the page block, so to go through to the back cover, the worm must go through the rest of Volume 1’s pages plus the back cover.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, the classic intended result is:\n\nTotal distance gnawed = thickness of all pages of both volumes + thickness of all covers between them that lie between the start and end points. Since the worm starts at the first page of Vol 1 and ends at the last page of Vol 2, the distances it must cross are:\n- The remaining pages of Volume 1 after the first page: essentially almost all of 2 cm\n- The back cover of Volume 1: 0.2 cm\n- The front cover of Volume 2: 0.2 cm\n- The pages of Volume 2 up to the last page: essentially all 2 cm\n\nAdding:\nRemaining pages of Vol 1 ≈ 2 cm\nBack cover of Vol 1 = 0.2 cm\nFront cover of Vol 2 = 0.2 cm\nPages of Vol 2 ≈ 2 cm\n\nTotal ≈ 2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 2 = 4.4 cm\n\nThus, the worm gnawed 4.4 cm."
